## Key Benefits

### Improved PvP Responsiveness
FastPing optimizes how incoming and outgoing packets are handled by your system. This can result in more consistent hit registration, smoother knockback behavior, reduced delay, and improved overall responsiveness in latency-sensitive environments.

### Instant Configuration Updates
Changes are applied immediately. No restarts, no reconnecting, and no disruption to gameplay or workflow.

### Safe and Rule-Compliant
FastPing does not inject into games, modify application memory, simulate lag, or interfere with servers. It operates strictly at the system configuration level and does not function as a cheat or exploit.

### Minimal and Focused
FastPing exposes only essential settings. The interface is intentionally simple, eliminating unnecessary options while managing complexity internally.
