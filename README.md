Features

Gain the edge in PvP
FastPing modifies the way your computer handles incoming and outgoing packets. The effects are most noticeable in hit registration, knockback, responsiveness, and anything connection-related in games.

No restarts needed
Tired of restarting every time you change your network settings? FastPing’s instant update protocol allows you to apply changes immediately without interrupting your gameplay or workflow.

Not a cheat
FastPing does not directly modify any games or applications. It is not a network limiter, lag switcher, or anything that violates rules—it only optimizes your preexisting computer settings.

Simple settings
No overwhelming menus or meaningless options. FastPing exposes only the essential settings, keeping everything simple while hiding complexity under the hood.
